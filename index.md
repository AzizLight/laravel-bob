#Bob

Bob can be used to generate all kinds of useful files and classes, for use with the wonderfully fabulous [http://www.laravel.com](Laravel PHP Framework), authored by [https://github.com/taylorotwell](Taylor Otwell).

If you have used ruby on rails' generate, or FuelPHP's Oil you will be familiar with its syntax.

Bob was created by Dayle Rees, with thanks to [https://phills.me.uk](Phill Sparks), [https://ericlbarnes.com](Eric Barnes) and [https://github.com/taylorotwell](Taylor Otwell) for all the help and support.

###Latest Changes:

* Nested resources can now be generated.
* PHPUnit tests can now be generated.
* Bundles can now be generated.
* Output is now colored for clarity.
* Many bug fixes and refactors.
