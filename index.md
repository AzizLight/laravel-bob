#Bob

![Bob Logo](http://daylerees.com/boblogo.png)

Bob can be used to generate all kinds of useful files and classes, for use with the wonderfully fabulous Laravel PHP Framework, authored by Taylor Otwell.

If you have used ruby on rails' generate, or FuelPHP's Oil you will be familiar with its syntax.

Bob was created by Dayle Rees, with thanks to Phill Sparks, Eric Barnes and Taylor Otwell for all the help and support.

**Latest Changes:**

* Nested resources can now be generated.
* PHPUnit tests can now be generated.
* Bundles can now be generated.
* Output is now colored for clarity.
* Many bug fixes and refactors.
