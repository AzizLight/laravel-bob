#Bob

Bob can be used to generate all kinds of useful files and classes, for use with the wonderfully fabulous [Laravel PHP Framework](http://www.laravel.com), authored by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell).

If you have used ruby on rails' generate, or FuelPHP's Oil you will be familiar with its syntax.

Bob was created by Dayle Rees, with thanks to [Phill Sparks](http://phills.me.uk), [Eric Barnes](http://ericlbarnes.com) and [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) for all the help and support.

###Latest Changes:

* Nested resources can now be generated.
* PHPUnit tests can now be generated.
* Bundles can now be generated.
* Output is now colored for clarity.
* Many bug fixes and refactors.
